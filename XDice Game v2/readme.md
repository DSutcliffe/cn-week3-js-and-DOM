# Dice Game

During week 3 of Code Nations Master Coding Course we were asked to create a 'Dice Game' and then make it our own.
Firstly it was a one player game with set rules.
Next, I added statistics, user was able to change the winnung value and lastly make it a 2 Player (or remain a single player) version.

##  Rules for the game

The user is able to select a one player or 2 player version of the dice game.
The user that rolls a 1, at any time losses right away!.
The user enters the winning value the players must achieve (without rolling a 1).
The first user, to continually roll the dice and add keep adding to the score (without rolling a 1!) and hit the winning value wins.

```javascript

console.log("Hello")

```

### What I liked

I liked putting what i had learnt into practice and managed to create the game without too many issues.

### What I need to look into more

1) I believe I can reduce the length of the code and will investigate it.
2) Might be an idea to introduce a 'Refresh Stats' button if switching from 1 to 2 Player version of the game.
